1. Example config files

Configuration of net-snmp is tedious due to its many
configuration options. Here is a list of templates to start
and that allow seamless testing using test.lua.

etc_snmp.conf => /etc/snmp/snmp.conf
	- system wide client configuration
	- defines the default user

snmp.conf => ~/.snmp/snmp.conf
	-- user local client configuration
	-- all kinds of client behaviors

snmpd.conf => /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
	-- system wide agent configuration
	-- general agent config
	
	Note: remove createUser directives from this 
	      readable file and place them into 
	      /var/lib/snmp/snmpd.conf
	      Here the readable values become hidden once snmpd starts.
	      We have them in /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf to have test.lua
	      to not fail.

share_snmpd.conf => /usr/share/snmp/snmpd.conf
	-- shared agent configuration
	-- list of users and communities

etc_snmpd.local.conf => /etc/snmp/snmpd.local.conf
	-- local agent configuration
	-- define sysLocation and sysContact
	
	Note: commented out for test purposes
